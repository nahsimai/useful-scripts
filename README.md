# useful-scripts

## Purpose of Repository
The main aim of this Repository is to collect scripts and ideas for tools that help you speed up your daily tasks. No code or idea is a bad one (yes there are exceptions), so don't shy away from contributing ;) Even if it's a link to another project, it's good to have it here.
